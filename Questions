1. How is a leader elected?
	- In Raft there are two timeout settings which control elections
	- First is the election timeout
		- The election timeout is the amount of time a follower waits until becoming a candidate
		- The election timeout should be randomized to be between 150ms and 300ms
		- After the election timeout the follower becomes a candidate and starts a new election term, votes for itself, and sends out Request Vote messages to other nodes.
		- If the receiving node hasn't voted yet in this term then it votes for the candidate, and the node resets its election timeout.
		- Once a candidate has a majority of votes it becomes leader
		- The leader begins sending out Append Entries messages to its followers
		- These messages are sent in intervals specified by the heartbeat timeout
		- Followers then respond to each Append Entries message
		- This election term will continue until a follower stops receiving heartbeats and becomes a candidate
		- If two nodes become candidates at the same time then a split vote can occur

3. What happens if two nodes timeout at the same time? (Split vote)
	- The nodes will wait for a new election and try again.

2. What happens if a node fails?
	- Leader election occurs

4. What happens in the event of a partition?
	- If a node cannot replicate to a majority its log entry stays uncommitted
	- That node will see the higher election term and step down after the partition is healed

5. How are changes made to the variables? (Log replication process)
	- Each change is added as an entry in the node's log
	- At first the log entry is uncommitted so it won't update the node's value
	- To commit the entry the node first replicates it to the follower nodes...
	- Then the leader waits until a majority of nodes have written the entry
	- The entry is now committed on the leader node and the node state is set
	- The leader then notifies the followers that the entry is committed
	- The cluster has now come to consensus about the system state
